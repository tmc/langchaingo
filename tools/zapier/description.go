		"You MUST take into account the params when creating the instruction. For example, if the params are " +
		"['Message_Text', 'Channel'], your instruction should be something like 'send a slack message to the " +

		"up params, they will be explicitly specified in the tool description. If you do not have enough information " +
		"to fill in the params, just say 'not enough information provided in the instruction, missing <param>'. If you " +
