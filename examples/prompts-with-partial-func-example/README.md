# Prompts with Partial Functions Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `langchaingo` library to create a prompt template with partial functions. The program showcases a simple yet powerful feature of dynamic prompt generation.

## What This Example Does

1. **Prompt Template Creation**: The example creates a `PromptTemplate` with a template string that includes placeholders for an adjective and a date.

2. **Partial Variables**: It uses a partial variable for the date, which is a function that returns the current date formatted as "Month Day, Year".

3. **Dynamic Date Insertion**: Every time the prompt is formatted, it automatically inserts the current date without needing to pass it as an input.

4. **User Input**: The program allows for the adjective to be provided as an input when formatting the prompt.

5. **Prompt Formatting**: It demonstrates how to format the prompt with the given input and the dynamically generated date.

6. **Output**: The formatted prompt is printed to the console.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Shows how to include dynamic content (current date) in prompts.
- **Partial Functions**: Demonstrates the use of partial variables with functions.
- **Flexible Templating**: Uses Go's template format for creating prompts.

## Running the Example

When you run this example, it will output a prompt asking for a joke about the current date. The adjective "funny" is hardcoded in this example, but you could easily modify it to accept user input.

Example output:
```
Tell me a funny joke about the day March 14, 2024
```

This example is great for understanding how to create more dynamic and context-aware prompts in your language model applications using `langchaingo`.
