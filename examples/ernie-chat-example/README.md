# Colorful Sock Company Namer ðŸ§¦ðŸŒˆ

Welcome to our fun little Go program that uses the power of AI to come up with an awesome name for a colorful sock company! ðŸŽ‰

## What Does This Do? 

This cool example shows how to use the ERNIE-Bot AI model to generate creative company names. Here's the lowdown:

1. We set up the ERNIE-Bot AI model with some special settings.
2. We tell the AI that it's a company branding design wizard (how cool is that?).
3. We ask it to suggest a great name for a company that makes colorful socks.
4. The program prints out the AI's response in real-time, so you can watch the magic happen!

## How to Use It

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your computer.
2. Replace the placeholder values for "ak", "sk", and "accesstoken" with your actual ERNIE-Bot credentials.
3. Run the program and watch as it generates a fantastic company name for your imaginary colorful sock business!
