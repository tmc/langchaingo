# Anthropic Completion Example

Hello there, fellow Go enthusiasts and AI adventurers! 👋 Welcome to this exciting example of using the Anthropic API with Go!

## What's in this directory?

This directory contains a simple yet powerful example of how to use the Anthropic API to generate text completions using Go. Here's what you'll find:

1. `anthropic_completion_example.go`: This is the main Go file that demonstrates how to use the Anthropic API. It's a great starting point for your AI-powered adventures!

2. `go.mod`: This file manages the dependencies for our project. It ensures we have all the right packages to make the magic happen.

## What does the code do?

The `anthropic_completion_example.go` file showcases how to:

- Initialize an Anthropic LLM (Language Model) client
- Generate text completions using the Claude 3 Opus model
- Stream the generated text in real-time

It even includes a fun prompt asking Claude to write a poem about Golang-powered AI systems! 🤖📝

## How to use this example

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Set up your Anthropic API key as an environment variable.
3. Run the example using `go run anthropic_completion_example.go`.
4. Watch as the AI-generated poem streams to your console!

## Dependencies

This project uses the fantastic `langchaingo` library to interact with the Anthropic API. It's a great tool for building AI-powered applications in Go!

## Have fun!

We hope this example inspires you to create amazing AI-powered applications using Go and Anthropic's powerful language models. Happy coding! 🚀🎉# Anthropic Completion Example
