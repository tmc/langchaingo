# Local LLM Example üöÄ

Welcome to the Local LLM Example! This nifty little Go program demonstrates how to use a local language model with the `langchaingo` library. It's perfect for those who want to run AI models on their own machines or servers. Let's dive in!

## What Does This Example Do? ü§î

This example shows you how to:

1. Set up a local LLM client
2. Generate text using a simple prompt
3. Customize the LLM configuration (with some cool commented-out options)

## The Magic Explained ‚ú®

Here's what's happening in our main function:

1. We create a new local LLM client using `local.New()`. This uses default settings from your environment.

2. We set up a context for our LLM operations.

3. We generate text by asking the LLM a simple question: "How many sides does a square have?"

4. Finally, we print the LLM's response!

## Cool Features to Explore üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

While the example uses default settings, it also shows you how to customize your LLM:

- You can specify a custom binary and arguments for your local LLM.
- There are options to set top-k, top-p, and seed values for text generation.
- You can even use global arguments as part of your LLM configuration!

## Running the Example üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Just compile and run the Go file, and you'll see the LLM's response to the square question. It's that simple!

## Have Fun! üéâ

This example is a great starting point for experimenting with local LLMs. Feel free to uncomment the additional options and play around with different configurations. Happy coding!
