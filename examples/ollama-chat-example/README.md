# Ollama Chat Example with LangChain Go

Welcome to this cheerful example of using LangChain Go with Ollama! 🎉

This fun little program demonstrates how to create a simple chat interaction using the Ollama language model through the LangChain Go library. Let's break down what this exciting code does!

## What Does This Example Do?

1. 🤖 It sets up an Ollama language model instance using the "mistral" model.

2. 🧙‍♂️ It creates a system message that instructs the AI to act as a "company branding design wizard".

3. 🧦 It then asks the AI a question: "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"

4. 🌈 The code generates a response from the AI, streaming the output in real-time.

5. 📺 As the AI generates its response, the program prints each chunk of text to the console, allowing you to see the answer unfold before your eyes!

## How to Run

To run this example, make sure you have Go installed and Ollama set up on your system. Then, simply execute the `ollama_chat_example.go` file:

```
go run ollama_chat_example.go
```

## What to Expect

When you run this program, you'll see the AI's response appear gradually in your console. It will suggest a creative and colorful name for a sock company, channeling its inner branding wizard! 🧙‍♂️🧦

## Have Fun!

This example is a great starting point for exploring more complex interactions with AI models using LangChain Go. Feel free to modify the system message or the question to experiment with different scenarios and see what creative responses you can get!

Happy coding, and may your socks always be colorful! 🌈👟
