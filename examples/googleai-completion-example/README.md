# Google AI Completion Example

Welcome to the Google AI Completion Example! This simple Go program demonstrates how to use the Google AI API to generate text completions using the `langchaingo` library.

## What This Example Does

This example:

1. Sets up a connection to the Google AI API using your API key.
2. Sends a prompt to the API asking "Who was the second person to walk on the moon?"
3. Receives and prints the generated response.

## How It Works

1. The program starts by setting up the context and retrieving your Google AI API key from the `API_KEY` environment variable.

2. It then initializes a new Google AI language model client using the `googleai.New()` function.

3. A prompt is defined: "Who was the second person to walk on the moon?"

4. The program sends this prompt to the Google AI model using `llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt()`.

5. Finally, it prints the generated answer to the console.

## Running the Example

To run this example:

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.

2. Set your Google AI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```
   go run googleai-completion-example.go
   ```

4. The program will output the AI-generated answer to the question about the second person to walk on the moon.

This example showcases how easy it is to integrate Google AI's powerful language models into your Go applications using the `langchaingo` library. Happy coding!
