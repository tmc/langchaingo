# OpenAI GPT-4o Vision Example

Welcome to this cheerful example of using OpenAI's GPT-4o vision model with Go! 🎉

This project demonstrates how to interact with OpenAI's powerful language model using the `langchaingo` library. It's a fantastic way to explore the capabilities of AI in your Go applications!

## What This Example Does

This example does some really cool stuff:

1. 🤖 It sets up a connection to OpenAI's GPT-4o model.
2. 💬 It prepares a conversation with the AI, telling it to act as a Bird expert.
3. 🗨️ It asks the AI a question about a what bird is it?
4. 🌊 It streams the AI's response in real-time, printing it to the console.

## How It Works

The magic happens in the `main()` function:

1. We create a new OpenAI client, specifically requesting the "gpt-4o" model.
2. We set up our conversation content, including a system message and a user question and image url.
3. We generate content from the AI, using a streaming function to print the response as it's received.

## Running the Example

To run this example, you'll need to:

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Set up your OpenAI API credentials (usually as environment variables).
3. Run the Go program!

## Have Fun!

This example is a great starting point for building more complex applications with AI. Feel free to modify the question, add more context, or expand on the functionality. The possibilities are endless! 🚀

Happy coding, and enjoy exploring the world of AI with Go! 😄
