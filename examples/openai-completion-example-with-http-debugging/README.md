# OpenAI Completion Example with HTTP Debugging

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ This example demonstrates how to use the LangChain Go library to generate text completions using OpenAI's language model, with the added feature of HTTP request and response debugging.

## What does this example do?

This nifty little program does the following:

1. Sets up an OpenAI language model client with optional HTTP debugging.
2. Generates a text completion for the prompt "The first man to walk on the moon".
3. Prints the generated completion to the console.

## Key Features

- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses the OpenAI API through the LangChain Go library.
- **HTTP Debugging**: Optionally logs all HTTP requests and responses for debugging purposes.
- **Command-line Flag**: Allows enabling/disabling HTTP debugging via a command-line flag.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
3. Run the program:
   ```
   go run openai_completion_example.go
   ```
4. To disable HTTP debugging, use the `-debug-http=false` flag:
   ```
   go run openai_completion_example.go -debug-http=false
   ```

## What to Expect

When you run the program, it will generate a completion for the prompt "The first man to walk on the moon". The result will be printed to the console.

If HTTP debugging is enabled (which it is by default), you'll also see detailed logs of the HTTP requests and responses made to the OpenAI API.

Happy exploring! ðŸš€ðŸŒ™
