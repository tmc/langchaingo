# ETL Process Example 🚀
=====================================

Welcome to this example of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in Go! 🎉

This simple yet powerful script demonstrates how to extract data from a MongoDB database, transform it by adding website information using a language model, and load the transformed data back into the database and a JSON file. Let's break down what this exciting code does! 🤔

## What Does This Example Do? 📝
------------------------------------

1. **Extracts Data from MongoDB** :
   The script connects to a MongoDB database and extracts unprocessed company data from a collection. 💻

2. **Transforms Data** :
   The script uses a language model to generate website information for each company and adds this information to the extracted data. 🤖

3. **Loads Transformed Data** :
   The script loads the transformed data back into the MongoDB database, replacing any existing documents in the collection.
   Additionally, it writes the transformed data to a JSON file. 💾

4. **Handles Errors** :
   The script includes error handling to ensure smooth operation and provide helpful feedback if something goes wrong. 🚨

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️
----------------------

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Set up your MongoDB database with the required collections and environment variables.
3. Run the script using: `go run .`

## What to Expect 🔮
---------------------

When you run this script, you'll see that it extracts data from your MongoDB database, transforms it by adding website information, and loads the transformed data back into the database and a JSON file.

## Fun Fact 🤓
-----------------

Did you know? You can customize this ETL process by modifying the language model prompt or adding additional transformation steps!
