# Prompts with Partial Example

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this fun little Go example that showcases how to use prompts with partial variables using the `langchaingo` library. Let's dive in and see what this code does!

## What's This All About?

This example demonstrates how to create a prompt template with both regular input variables and partial variables. It's a great way to see how flexible and powerful prompt templates can be!

## The Magic Explained

Here's what's happening in our code:

1. We create a `PromptTemplate` with the following properties:
   - A template string: `"{{.foo}}{{.bar}}"`
   - An input variable: `"bar"`
   - A partial variable: `"foo"` with the value `"foo"`
   - The template format is set to Go's template format

2. We then format the prompt by providing a value for the `"bar"` variable.

3. Finally, we print the result!

## What to Expect

When you run this code, you'll see the output:

```
foobaz
```

Isn't that neat? The `"foo"` comes from our partial variable, and `"baz"` is the value we provided for the `"bar"` input variable.

## Why This Matters

This example shows how you can create flexible templates with some pre-defined parts (partial variables) and other parts that can be filled in later (input variables). It's super useful for creating dynamic prompts in various applications!

## Give It a Try!

Feel free to play around with the code. Try changing the template, adding more variables, or experimenting with different values. The world of prompt templates is your oyster! ðŸ¦ª

Happy coding, and may your prompts always be perfectly formatted! ðŸš€âœ¨
