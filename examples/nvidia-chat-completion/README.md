# NVIDIA Chat Completion Example

Welcome to this exciting example of using NVIDIA's AI services with Go! ðŸš€

This project demonstrates how to leverage NVIDIA's API to perform chat completions using a powerful language model. It's a great way to see how easily you can integrate advanced AI capabilities into your Go applications.

## What This Example Does

1. **Connects to NVIDIA's API**: The code sets up a connection to NVIDIA's API using your API key.

2. **Uses a Specific Model**: It's configured to use the "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1" model, which is a large language model capable of generating human-like text.

3. **Sets Up a Chat Scenario**: The example creates a chat scenario where the AI is instructed to be a Golang expert.

4. **Generates Content**: It then asks the AI to explain why Go is a great fit for AI-based products.

5. **Streams the Response**: The AI's response is streamed in real-time, printing each chunk of the answer as it's generated.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Set the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable with your NVIDIA API key.
3. Run the example using `go run nvidia_chat_completion_example.go`.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Shows how simple it is to integrate NVIDIA's AI services into a Go application.
- **Streaming Responses**: Demonstrates real-time streaming of AI-generated content.
- **Customizable Prompts**: You can easily modify the system message and user prompt to explore different scenarios.

This example is perfect for developers looking to add AI-powered chat capabilities to their Go projects or those curious about how to interact with large language models programmatically.

Have fun exploring the world of AI with Go and NVIDIA! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤–
