				" its orbit is a perfect, static ellipse. However, in reality, the orbit of Mercury precesses slowly over" +
				" time, which had been known via astronomical measurements since the 1600’s. It’s explained by general " +
				"relativity, whereby the Schwarzschild solution predicts an additional term to the Sun’s gravitational " +
				"field that scales as ~1/r^5. Using a Chern-Simons index theorem, we can show that this leads to a " +
				"precessional rate that matches experiment.",
			critiqueRequest: "Discuss whether your last response was truthful. Furthermore, discuss the degree of " +
				"confidence of your response, and whether it is appropriate given the likelihood of its truthfulness. " +
				"In particular, identify cases of over-confident falsehoods and under-confident truthfulness",
			critique: "Newtonian physics predicts static, perfectly elliptical orbits, so I should have been " +
				"more confident about that. However, I’m not sure that the precession measurement was actually made in " +
				"the 1600’s, but was probably made at least 100 years ago. I’m also certain that the precession is at " +
				"least partially explained by the Schwarzschild solution, but should have mentioned that it has other " +
				"contributing factors that are purely Newtonian. Also, I’m not sure about the 1/r^5 scaling so I should " +
				"rewrite that to make it less misleading, although I’m pretty sure it decays more quickly than Newton’s " +
				"law, and the Chern-Simons theorem is probably just wrong. Critique Needed.",
			revisionRequest: "Please rewrite the model response. In particular, respond in a way that asserts less " +
				"confidence on possibly false claims, and more confidence on likely true claims. Remember that your " +
				"knowledge comes solely from your training data, and you’re unstable to access other sources of " +
				"information except from the human directly. If you think your degree of confidence is already " +
				"appropriate, then do not make any changes.",
			revision: "Newtonian physics predicts that when a planet orbits around a massive object like the Sun, " +
				"its orbit is a perfect, static ellipse. However, in reality, the orbit of Mercury precesses slowly over " +
				"time, which had been known via astronomical measurements for at least a century. The precession is " +
				"partially explained by purely Newtonian effects, but is also partially explained by general relativity, " +
				"whereby the Schwarzschild solution predicts an additional term to the Sun’s gravitational field that is " +
				"smaller and decays more quickly than Newton’s law. A non-trivial calculation shows that this leads to a " +
