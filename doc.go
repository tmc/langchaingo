/*
The langsmith package provides a client for interacting with LangSmith services. It offers a flexible configuration system using functional options, enabling easy customization of client behavior. The client integrates with LLM chain calls via the CallbackHandler interface, ensuring seamless interaction.

The package defines two main types:
 1. Client: Handles interactions with the LangSmith API. This type is designed to be instantiated once for the lifetime of the application.
 2. Tracer: Tracks the execution of LangChain processes. A new instance should be created for each run.

This design promotes clean and extensible client initialization, making the package adaptable to various use cases.
