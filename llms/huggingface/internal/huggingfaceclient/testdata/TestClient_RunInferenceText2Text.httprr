[{"generated_text":"Translate to French: Hello, how are you?\n\nThe French phrase for \"hello\" is \"bonjour\" (pronounced bohn-JOOR). The French phrase for \"how are you?\" is \"comment ça va?\" (pronounced kom-MAHN sah-VAH).\n\nHere's how you might say hello and ask how someone is doing in French:\n\nBonjour, comment ça va? (pronounced bohn-JOOR koh-MAHN sah-VAH)\n\nThis is a common greeting in French, and it's polite to ask how someone is doing before getting into the conversation.\n\nNote that in French, \"ça\" (pronounced sah) is a contraction of \"ce que\" (pronounced seh KUH), which means \"what.\" So \"comment ça va?\" (pronounced kom-MAHN sah-VAH) can be translated literally as \"how what's going?\" or \"how is it going?\"\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}]
