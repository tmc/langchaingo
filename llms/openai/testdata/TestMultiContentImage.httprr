It has a vibrant green body with a gradient that transitions to yellow and orange on its wings and tail. The head is primarily yellow with a hint of red on the top. The parrot has a dark gray beak and feet, and its eye is black with a small white highlight, giving it a lively appearance. The background is black, which makes the bright colors of the parrot stand out.",
