# Tutorials

Welcome to the LangChainGo tutorials! These step-by-step guides help you build complete applications using LangChainGo.

## Learning path

Follow these tutorials in order to progressively learn LangChainGo:

### 1. Foundation applications
- [Building a simple chat application](./basic-chat-app) - Learn the basics with conversation memory
- [AI Code Reviewer](./code-reviewer) - Analyze Go code for bugs, style, and performance issues
- [Intelligent Log Analyzer](./log-analyzer) - Parse and analyze application logs with AI insights

### 2. Advanced applications  
- [Smart documentation generator](./smart-documentation) - Auto-generate API docs from your codebase

### 3. Coming soon

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, ensure you have:

- Go 1.21 or later installed
- An API key for at least one LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with Go programming

## What you'll learn

These tutorials go beyond simple chatbots to show practical applications:

- **Code analysis**: Build tools that understand and improve code quality
- **Log intelligence**: Extract insights from application logs and detect anomalies  
- **Documentation automation**: Generate and maintain technical documentation
- **Core patterns**: Master LangChainGo's interfaces and Go idioms
- **Production skills**: Deploy, monitor, and scale AI-powered applications
- **Integration techniques**: Connect with external tools and services

Let's get started with your first LangChainGo application!
