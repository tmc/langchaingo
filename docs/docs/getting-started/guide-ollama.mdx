# Quickstart, using Ollama

This tutorial gives you a quick walkthrough about running your first program with LangChainGo and [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).

[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) is the easiest way to get set up with local LLM inference on any computer.

## Steps

To get started, install LangChain but running the following command in the directory of your project:

1. [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) Download and install Ollama.
2. In a terminal, run a 7B llama2 model: `$ ollama run llama2` (note that this will take some time the first time you run it as you need to fetch the model to your computer).
## Installation
3. Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).
4. Run `go run github.com/tmc/langchaingo/examples/ollama-completion-example@main`

You should see output such as:

```shell
$ go run github.com/tmc/langchaingo/examples/ollama-completion-example@main
The first human to set foot on the moon was Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut, who stepped onto the lunar surface during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969.
```

That's it! You've built and run your first open source LLM based program using local inference.

Here is the entire program (from [ollama-chat-example](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo/blob/main/examples/ollama-chat-example/ollama_chat_example.go)).

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"
	"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/ollama"
	"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/schema"
)

func main() {
	llm, err := ollama.NewChat(ollama.WithLLMOptions(ollama.WithModel("llama2")))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	ctx := context.Background()
	completion, err := llm.Call(ctx, []schema.ChatMessage{
		schema.SystemChatMessage{Content: "Give a precise answer to the question based on the context. Don't be verbose."},
		schema.HumanChatMessage{Content: "What would be a good company name a company that makes colorful socks? Give me 3 examples."},
	}, llms.WithStreamingFunc(func(ctx context.Context, chunk []byte) error {
		fmt.Print(string(chunk))
		return nil
	}),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(completion)
}
```
