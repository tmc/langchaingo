# Unfinished Quickstart, using Chat Models

Chat models are a variation on language models.
While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose is a bit different.
Rather than expose a "text in, text out" API, they expose an interface where "chat messages" are the inputs and outputs.

## Installation

To get started, install LangChain with the following command:

```bash 
go get github.com/tmc/langchaingo
```

## Getting Started


### Chat Models: Message in, Message out


#### Multiple Messages


#### Multiple Completions

``

### Chat Prompt Templates: Manage Prompts for Chat Models


### Model + Prompt = LLMChain


### Agents: Dynamically Run Chains Based on User Input


### Memory: Add State to Chains and Agents

## Streaming
