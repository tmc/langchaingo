# Unfinished quickstart, using chat models

Chat models are a variation on language models.
While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose is a bit different.
Rather than expose a "text in, text out" API, they expose an interface where "chat messages" are the inputs and outputs.

## Installation

To get started, install LangChain with the following command:

```bash 
go get github.com/tmc/langchaingo
```

## Getting started


### Chat models: message in, message out


#### Multiple messages


#### Multiple completions

``

### Chat prompt templates: manage prompts for chat models


### Model + prompt = LLM chain


### Agents: dynamically run chains based on user input


### Memory: add state to chains and agents

## Streaming
