# Model I/0

Working with language models can often be divided into three steps. 

 - Firstly constructing the input to the model. In langchain this is done using the [prompts package](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/).
 - Next the input must be sent to the model. This is easy to do using the [model package](/docs/modules/model_io//). 
 - In many cases, information needs to be extracted from the model output. Doing this is simple using the [output parser package](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parser)
