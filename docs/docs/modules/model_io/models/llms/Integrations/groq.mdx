# Groq

## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed overview and technical guidance for integrating Groq's machine learning models with the Langchaingo library in the Go programming environment. This integration allows Go developers to leverage the power of pre-trained AI models for various applications, including natural language processing, text generation, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Go programming language installed on your machine (version 1.22.0 or higher recommended).
-  A valid Groq API key. Obtain it by creating an account on the Groq platform and generating a new token.

## Installation

To install the Groq package in your Go project, run the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/tmc/langchaingo
```

Ensure that your Groq API key is set as an environment variable:
    
    ```bash
    export GROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

You can use .env file to store the API key and load it in your Go application.

.env file:

    ```bash
    GROQ_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
but you not need use godotenv package to load the .env file.
