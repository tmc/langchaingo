# Data Connection 

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/indexing)
:::

Many LLM applications require user-specific data that is not part of the model's training set. LangChain gives you the 
building blocks to load, transform, store and query your data via:

- [Document loaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Load documents from many different sources
- [Text splitter](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_splitters/): Split documents and texts
- [Vector stores](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Store and search over embedded data
- [Retrievers](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Query your data
