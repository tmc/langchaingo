# Getting Started: Vector Stores

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/indexing/vectorstore)
:::

A vector store is a particular type of database optimized for storing documents and their [embeddings](../../models/embeddings/), and then fetching of the most relevant documents for a particular query, ie. those whose embeddings are most similar to the embedding of the query.

## All Vector Stores

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

<DocCardList />
