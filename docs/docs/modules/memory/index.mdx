# Memory

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](../../concepts/) • [How-to Guides](../../how-to/)
:::

Memory enables LangChain Go applications to persist state between calls, maintaining conversation context and enabling sophisticated, stateful interactions.

## Key Concepts

Memory in LangChain Go provides several critical capabilities:

- **Conversation History**: Store and retrieve past messages and responses
- **Context Management**: Maintain relevant context across multiple interactions  
- **State Persistence**: Save conversation state to various storage backends
- **Memory Types**: Different strategies for managing conversation context

:::warning
Do not share the same memory instance between different chains. Each memory instance represents the history of a single conversation and should be isolated.
:::

## Memory Types

### Buffer Memory
Stores all conversation messages in a simple buffer. Best for short conversations where you want complete history.

### Window Buffer Memory  
Maintains a sliding window of recent messages. Useful when you want to limit context length while preserving recent history.

### Token Buffer Memory
Manages memory based on token count rather than message count. Provides precise control over context size for LLM token limits.

### Summary Memory
Automatically summarizes older conversation history while keeping recent messages intact. Balances context preservation with memory efficiency.

### Chat Message History
Provides a lower-level interface for managing individual chat messages. Useful for custom memory implementations.

## Storage Options

LangChain Go memory can persist to various backends:

- **In-Memory**: Fast, temporary storage (default)
- **File-based**: Simple persistence to local files
- **Database**: SQL or NoSQL database integration
- **Redis**: High-performance, distributed memory storage
- **Custom**: Implement your own storage backend

## Memory Integration Patterns

### With Chains
Chains automatically handle memory integration:

```go
chain := chains.NewConversationChain(llm, memory)
```

### With Agents
Agents use memory to maintain context across tool calls:

```go
agent := agents.NewConversationalAgent(llm, tools, agents.WithMemory(memory))
```

### Manual Memory Management
For custom applications, manage memory directly:

```go
// Add user message
memory.ChatHistory.AddUserMessage(ctx, userInput)

// Add AI response  
memory.ChatHistory.AddAIMessage(ctx, aiResponse)

// Retrieve conversation history
messages, err := memory.ChatHistory.Messages(ctx)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Appropriate Memory Type**: Select based on conversation length and context requirements
2. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Track memory growth and implement cleanup strategies
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement fallback behavior when memory operations fail
4. **Consider Privacy**: Be mindful of sensitive data in conversation history
5. **Test Memory Behavior**: Verify memory works correctly across conversation flows
