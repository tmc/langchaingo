# Getting Started: Chains

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/chains)
:::info

Using a language model in isolation is fine for some applications, but it is often useful to combine language models with other sources of information, third-party APIs, or even other language models. This is where the concept of a chain comes in.

LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, as well as a number of built-in chains that can be used out of the box. You can also create your own chains by creating structs that implement the chain interface.

## Executing chains

In LangChain there are multiple functions ment to execute chains.

### Call
Call is the standard function used for executing an chain. The function takes a context, the chain to be executed and the input values of the chain. The input values is a map with string keys and any value. The function returns the output values of the chain and a potential error.

```go
res, err := chains.Call(
  context.Background(),
  chain,
  map[string]any{
    "product": "colorful socks",
  },
)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(res)
```

```
map[text:

Socktastic!]
```

### Run
If a chain only expects one input and returns a string the run function can be used to execute the chain. The privious example could therefore be written like this:

```go
text, err := chains.Run(
    context.Background(),
    chain,
    "colorful socks",
)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(text)
```

```
Socktastic!
```

### Predict
Many chains expect multiple input values and retruns one string. For these cases the predict function is handy.

```go
text, err := chains.Predict(
    context.Background(),
    chain,
    map[string]any{
      "product": "colorful socks",
      "description": "The company is based in California"
    }
)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println(text)
```

## Advanced

To implement your own custom chain you must create an struct that implements the chain interface. 

```go
// Chain is the interface all chains must implement.
type Chain interface {
  // Call runs the logic of the chain and returns the output. This method should
	// not be called directly. Use rather the Call, Run or Predict functions that
	// handles the memory and other aspects of the chain.
	Call(ctx context.Context, inputs map[string]any, options ...ChainCallOption) (map[string]any, error)
	// GetMemory gets the memory of the chain.
	GetMemory() schema.Memory
	// InputKeys returns the input keys the chain expects.
	GetInputKeys() []string
	// OutputKeys returns the output keys the chain expects.
	GetOutputKeys() []string
}
```
