# Unfinished Agents

:::info
[Conceptual Guide](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents)
:::

Some applications will require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools, but potentially an unknown chain that depends on the user's input. In these types of chains, there is a “agent” which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the agent can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call.
