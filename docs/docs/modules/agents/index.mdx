# Agents

Agents enable autonomous behavior by allowing language models to dynamically choose which tools to use based on user input. Unlike predetermined chains, agents make real-time decisions about their actions.

## Core Concepts

An agent system consists of several key components:

- **Agent**: The decision-making component that chooses which tools to use
- **Tools**: The available functions/APIs the agent can invoke
- **Executor**: Manages the agent's execution loop and tool invocation
- **Memory**: Maintains conversation context across agent interactions

## How Agents Work

1. **Receive Input**: Agent receives a user query or task
2. **Plan Action**: Agent analyzes the input and decides which tool(s) to use
3. **Execute Tool**: Agent invokes the selected tool with appropriate parameters
4. **Process Result**: Agent evaluates the tool's output
5. **Decide Next Step**: Agent determines if more actions are needed or if the task is complete
6. **Respond**: Agent provides a final response to the user

## Agent Types

### MRKL Agent (ReAct)
Uses a Reasoning and Acting pattern where the agent alternates between thinking about what to do and taking actions.

### OpenAI Functions Agent
Leverages OpenAI's function calling capabilities for more structured tool usage and parameter passing.

### Conversational Agent
Designed for multi-turn conversations, maintaining context while using tools to assist with tasks.

### Plan-and-Execute Agent
Creates a plan of actions first, then executes each step systematically.

## Available Tools

LangChainGo provides several built-in tools:

- **Calculator**: Perform mathematical calculations
- **Web Search**: Search the internet for information
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and manipulate files
- **Database Query**: Execute database operations
- **API Calls**: Make HTTP requests to external services
- **Custom Tools**: Create your own tools for specific use cases

## Building Agents

### Basic Agent Setup

```go
// Create tools
tools := []tools.Tool{
    tools.Calculator{},
    tools.WebSearch{APIKey: "your-api-key"},
}

// Create agent
agent := agents.NewOneShotAgent(llm, tools)

// Create executor
executor := agents.NewExecutor(agent)

// Execute
result, err := executor.Call(ctx, map[string]any{
    "input": "What is 25 * 4 and what's the weather like today?",
})
```

### Custom Tools

```go
type CustomTool struct{}

func (c CustomTool) Name() string {
    return "custom_tool"
}

func (c CustomTool) Description() string {
    return "Performs custom operations"
}

func (c CustomTool) Call(ctx context.Context, input string) (string, error) {
    // Your custom logic here
    return "Tool result", nil
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Tool Selection**: Choose tools that complement each other and cover your use case
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Design clear tool descriptions and agent prompts
3. **Error Recovery**: Implement fallback strategies for tool failures
4. **Resource Management**: Set timeouts and limits on tool execution
5. **Security**: Validate tool inputs and sanitize outputs
6. **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and decision quality
